--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The DataDrivenCorrection Bundle--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This collection of Matlab scripts implements the data driven approach introduced by Vishwakarma et al. 2016. It uses a few matlab functions from Filter bundle and GSHS bundle, which are using the uberall bundle. 
Therefore we suggest that please dowload all the bundles. Please use the following citation if you use this work

Citation: Dutt Vishwakarma, B., B. Devaraju, and N. Sneeuw (2016), Minimizing the effects of filtering on catchment scale GRACE solutions, Water Resour. Res., 52, doi:10.1002/2016WR018960.

The full paper can be downloaded from the following web link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016WR018960/full

The mask file- Zbn.mat has many catchments. Each catchments is denoted by a number, which is the key. One can find the corresponding catchment in the Basin_ID_Catchments.xls file and vice-versa.

Please note that this is the first release and it can only implement Gaussian filter along with a destriping filter. User can choose the filter radius and switch the destriping filter on and off.

We will update the bundle as we implement other filter types also.

We hope that you have a good experience. Please contact us at vishwakarma@gis.uni-stuttgart.de for any questions.
